Christopher Teixeira is the Acting Department Head for the Model-Based Analytics Department within MITRE. He is responsible for leading a department of about 50 individuals with backgrounds in policy, statistics, modeling and simulation, operations research, and data visualization expertise. As the Acting Department Head, he helps staff navigate their careers, evaluate their performances, and identify training opportunities to grow their technical skills. In addition, he works alongside federal sponsors to help identify potential solutions to challenges, writing up proposals, and working through the contracting process to establish new projects appropriate for staff in the department.

During his tenure at MITRE, he has supported multiple federally funded research and development centers across a variety of projects, such as supporting the Department of Energy in understanding how to safely and effectively treat nuclear waste and helping the Veterans Benefits Administration use sophisticated modeling techniques to better serve veterans. Recently, Christopher led a project that used a variety of advanced analytical techniques to define and identify opioid prescribing behaviors. In this role, he led a team of 20 data scientists and presented this material in public meetings to a group of Chief Medical Officers, State Commissioners, public health experts, and data scientists. He earned an M.S. in operations research from George Mason University and a B.S. in mathematics from Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
