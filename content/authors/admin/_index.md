Christopher Teixeira is a Principal Data Scientist in the Model-Based Analytics Department within the MITRE Labs. Heâ€™s responsible for providing his expertise in statistics, applied probability, modeling and simulation, and operations research to a variety of challenges that the federal government faces. In particular, he works directly with multiple federal agencies to identify potential solutions to the challenges they face and how best to use data to drive decisions they need to make. This includes helping them distinguish between the advantages and differences of varying analytical techniques. This breadth of knowledge and applications has led Chris towards becoming an expert at shaping efforts with sponsors including writing the contract language, cost proposals, and technical proposals across multiple efforts over the years. 

Chris served in a variety of roles over the course of his career at MITRE. He first joined as an individual contributor serving several sponsors by applying his background in Applied Statistics and Operations Research. This includes supporting multiple federally funded research and development centers across a variety of projects, such as supporting the Department of Energy in understanding how to safely and effectively treat nuclear waste and helping the Veterans Benefits Administration use sophisticated modeling techniques to better serve veterans. Recently, Christopher led a project that used a variety of advanced analytical techniques to define and identify opioid prescribing behaviors. In this role, he led a team of 20 data scientists and presented this material in public meetings to a group of Chief Medical Officers, State Commissioners, public health experts, and data scientists. He earned an M.S. in operations research from George Mason University and a B.S. in mathematics from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 

During his tenure at MITRE, Chris has served in multiple roles to help the organization and staff grow.  

### Acting Department Head for the Model-Based Analytics Department 

As the acting Department head, he was responsible for leading a department of about 50 individuals with backgrounds in policy, statistics, modeling and simulation, operations research, and data visualization expertise. Chris helped staff navigate their careers, evaluate their performances, and identify training opportunities to grow their technical skills. Chris worked with the Human Resources department to post job requisitions, review resumes, interview and hire staff into the department. 

### Chief Engineer for the Model-Based Analytics Department 

As the Department Chief Engineer, he worked alongside federal sponsors to help identify potential solutions to challenges, writing up proposals, and working through the contracting process to establish new projects appropriate for staff in the department. He supported early career staff in reviewing approaches to their work and engaging with staff across multiple divisions. Chris supported staff in sharing their research ideas, pulling together proposals, and finding team members to help them execute their research projects. 

### Group Leader for the Model-Based Analytics Department 

As a Group Leader, Chris managed a group of six staff members ranging from early career to mid-career professionals. In this role, he helped staff evaluate their performances, find projects to work on, and provide guidance on how to grow and shape a career path within MITRE. He also worked with department leadership and staff to promote a culture of trust, excellence, teamwork, respect, and continued learning and innovation to maintain a highly skilled workforce.
