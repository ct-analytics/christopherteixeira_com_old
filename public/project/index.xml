      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Children at Risk research project looks at which information is important at determining which children under the age of ten are at higher risk for fatality due to abuse and neglect. Leading a small team, we&amp;rsquo;ve collected data from multiple parts of a local Health and Human Services Agency to bring together and understand some of the data quality issues that might exist in other HHS agencies. We use R (specifically the CARET library) to identify which factors are the most important in determining children who are at higher risk due to fatality. Using this information, we hope to design a data visualization tool that will help caseworkers identify those children at higher risk of fatality due to abuse and neglect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/project/jieddo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I support JIEDDO using various analytical techniques including Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Regression Analysis. I created and tested a metric to help support decision making for various groups of people working with JIEDDO. I transferred complicated projects in EXCEL and ACCESS to SAS, improving the run-time and product quality. I created SAS Stored Processes to help streamline report generation, support business intelligence, and produce high quality graphics for all customers. I wrote a process to clean raw data and format the data using regular expression parsing on ingest of the data feeds. I integrated a process to parse XML files and create new databases from the results, making new sources of data available for a multitude of colleagues. I designed a database to enhance reporting and help determine an optimal solution to a resource allocation problem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/project/nvss/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The teams in the Northern Virginia Senior Softball (NVSS) league are reorganized every year with the desire to make them as even as possible and promote social interactions. This projectâs goals were to develop a methodology to produce team assignments for players such that the teams are equal in regards to player ability and other attributes. Multiple regression was employed to obtain offensive, defensive, and team metrics. An integer program (IP) model was developed where constraints were aligned with the goals of the NVSS league to solve the assignment problem. The IP model was linked to a team assignment tool which allows the user to select settings and parameters before running the model.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Statistical Analysis of Defensive Production in Major League Baseball</title>
      <link>/project/mqp/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/mqp/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While many statistical measures have been devised to measure team and player performance in professional baseball, relatively little work has been done to study and improve measures of defensive performance. This projectâs goals were to model defensive contribution to team performance and develop related measures of individual player defensive production. Factor analysis was employed to extract positional factors and combine them with pitching and offensive measures into a final logistic regression model to determine effects of defense on team performance.&lt;/p&gt;
