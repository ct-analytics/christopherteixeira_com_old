      <title>State Engagement to Address Opioid Overprescribing and Misuse</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As project and technical lead, I oversee the management and technical direction for this project. I work closely with sponsors from the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services and New Hampshire State Officials while directing an interdisciplinary team of 30 staff members to achieve the project&amp;rsquo;s outcomes. I had the pleasure of working with a diverse group of individuals, from statisticians and computer scientists, to clinicians and opioid experts, to communications and fraud specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project focused on using data to understand opioid prescribing habits with the goal of being able to identify abnormal prescribing habits. In order to do this, we utilized various analytical techniques from custom heuristics to statistical models to machine learning models. In order for our sponsors to fully utilize the results from the analytical models, we supported the creation of two working groups in New Hampshire. The first group, the Opioid Prescribing Advisory Council, which helps advise the approaches on the analytics and how data is used, but will support New Hampshire in recommending policy changes to curb opioid overprescribing behaviors. The second group, the Program Integrity Task Force, utilizes the results from the analytics to collaborate and reduce opioid overprescribing in the state. Lastly, this project created an interactive dashboard to measure the states progress in reducing opioid overprescribing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Department of Energy Cost and Schedule Tool</title>
      <link>https://christopherteixeira.com/project/doe-cost-and-schedule-tool/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://christopherteixeira.com/project/doe-cost-and-schedule-tool/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developed a discrete simulation model capable of performing lifecycle cost and schedule analysis. This model supports executives that make decisions on alternative strategies which are expected to cost on the order of tens of billions of dollars. The model, built entirely in JavaScript using SIM.JS, allows users to configure the schedule and efficiency of each alternative. After the model completes, results are displayed using a combination of D3 and TimelineJS libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Financial Metrics Visual Model</title>
      <link>https://christopherteixeira.com/project/financial-metrics-visual-model/</link>

      <guid>https://christopherteixeira.com/project/financial-metrics-visual-model/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Financial Metrics Visual Model is a tool designed to help MITRE leadership understand the impact of their decisions on high-level MITRE financial metrics. Working with members of the MITRE Finance department, I created a interactive system dynamics model that will allow the user to adjust high level inputs to see how they impact both MITRE financial metrics and other intermediate values used in calculating those metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JIEDDO - Operations Research and Systems Analysis Support</title>
      <link>https://christopherteixeira.com/project/jieddo/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://christopherteixeira.com/project/jieddo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I support JIEDDO using various analytical techniques including Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Regression Analysis. I created and tested a metric to help support decision making for various groups of people working with JIEDDO. I transferred complicated projects in EXCEL and ACCESS to SAS, improving the run-time and product quality. I created SAS Stored Processes to help streamline report generation, support business intelligence, and produce high quality graphics for all customers. I wrote a process to clean raw data and format the data using regular expression parsing on ingest of the data feeds. I integrated a process to parse XML files and create new databases from the results, making new sources of data available for a multitude of colleagues. I designed a database to enhance reporting and help determine an optimal solution to a resource allocation problem.&lt;/p&gt;
